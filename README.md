# solar-strandbeest

This is the initial design based upon Theo Jansenâ€™s Strandbeest proportions.  The current version uses 6mm dowels for the main drive chain.  4mm dowels are used to support the body and anchor links.  3mm dowels are used for leg joints.

Currently the design has the following flaws:
1. Center of gravity is a little high and one sided when fully assembled.
2. The leg joints have too much play when using wood only junctions.

The center of gravity issue is more pronounced with the amount of leg play.  This can currently be counter acted by adding weights to the opposite side.

The play in the legs will likely require the use of bearings and screws for the joints instead of plain wood joints.

The overall design is done in 2D for a laser cutter.  However, if desired, much can be extruded by pushing the plane of the components.
