# solar-strandbeest

This is the initial design based upon Theo Jansen’s Strandbeest proportions.

The current version uses 6mm dowels for the main drive chain.  4mm dowels are used to support the body and anchor links.  3mm dowels are used for leg joints.

Currently the design has the following flaws:
1. Center of gravity is a little high and one sided when fully assembled.
2. The leg joints have too much play when using wood only junctions.

The center of gravity issue is more pronounced with the amount of leg play.  This can currently be counter acted by adding weights to the opposite side.

The play in the legs will likely require the use of bearings and screws for the joints instead of plain wood joints.

The overall design is done in 2D for a laser cutter.  However, if desired, much can be extruded by pushing the plane of the components.

The gear design uses 11 teeth for the small gear and 55 teeth for the large gear.  The general plan was made using the following site:

The FreeCAD plans include a 5 post internal hub that is swapped out in LightBurn.  FreeCAD does have a way to make gears, but it does not lend itself to 2D design (or I just don’t know how to do it).
